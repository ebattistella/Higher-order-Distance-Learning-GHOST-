# Higher-order-Distance-Learning-GHOST-
Implement a higher-order generalization of the framework proposed in Komodakis, N. (2011, November). Learning to cluster using high order graphical models with latent variables. In 2011 International Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 73-80). IEEE.

This algorithm has been published in [Battistella 2022](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03563705/).

Main is in distance_learning_higher_order.py and will launch the learning and classification over a synthesized dataset.
